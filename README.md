<h1 align="center">üåà Rainbeam</h1>

Rainbeam is a simple Q&A social network designed for community! On Rainbeam, users can create and customize their profile to look how they want, and then other users can ask them questions using their account or an anonymous username. Users receive questions in their inbox and can then answer them or manage them. Users can also ask ‚Äúglobal questions‚Äù which everybody who is following them can see in a specialized timeline. Global questions can be answered by any logged-in user. Users can also respond to existing responses with comments to further interact with their friends' responses!

## Usage

To start, clone the Rainbeam repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swmff/rainbeam
cd rainbeam
just build sqlite
```

Instead of ‚Äúsqlite‚Äù, you can also use ‚Äúmysql" or "postgres‚Äù for MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL respectively!

### Configuration

You can configure Rainbeam in the configuration file located at `./.config/config.toml`. This file will be created for you when the server is first run.

### hCaptcha

Rainbeam requires hCaptcha to secure logins and registers. You can provide your h-captcha configuration in `./.config/config.toml`:

```toml
# ...
[captcha]
site_key = "..."
secret = "..."
```

You can sign up for an hCaptcha account at <https://www.hcaptcha.com/>!

### Moderation

After you have created your first account, you'll need to manually create a permissions group in the database so that you can mark the account as a `Manager`. The manager permission allows you to delete accounts, responses, comments, and questions. You can also view profile warnings and reports with this permission. You can view an example SQL query to do this [here](https://github.com/swmff/rainbeam/blob/master/sql/moderation.sql)!

You can add additional moderators with the `Helper` role. They can also be given `Manager`, however `Helper` is much better if you want them to have limited moderation abilities.

### Account registration

To open your instance up for free account registration, you'll need to set `registration_enabled` to `true` in `./.config/config.toml`.

### PWA

You are responsible for adding your own `manifest.json` file in the `static/` directory.

You can place your PWA logo images in `static/images/logo/`. This directory is ignored by git.
