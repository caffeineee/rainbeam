# Desktop

While all other crates in this repository are not specific to Neospring, this one is specifically linked to Neospring. Configuration has been provided in the source to make it easy to switch to a different domain, but that will require a fork to do.

The desktop app is essentially just a window for the Neospring website, except it enables the "System" settings tab and send system notifications for certain events.
